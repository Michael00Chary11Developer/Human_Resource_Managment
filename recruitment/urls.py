URL Configuration for Recruitment API.

1. 'router': Creates the router for the 'RecruitmentViews' and automatically generates standard routes for it.
2. 'router.register': Registers the viewset with the router, handling all 'CRUD' operations under the "manage" path.
3. 'include(router.urls)': Includes all the automatically generated URLs from the router in the urlpatterns.
4. Additional paths are manually defined for filtering based on 'recruitment_condition' and 'recruitment_possition'.

Endpoints:
- 'manage/': Default CRUD operations for Recruitment.
- 'condition/<recruitment_condition>/': Filters recruitments by condition (GET request).
- 'possition/<recruitment_possition>/': Filters recruitments by position (GET request).
